## How It Works

The bot runs an **AI agent loop** (up to 10 iterations) that can reason, call tools, inspect results, and call more tools before delivering a final answer. You interact via two modes:

1. **Natural language** — type any question and the agent researches it using its tools
2. **Slash commands** — quick shortcuts for common actions (see below)

### Switching Models

Type `/model` to pick your LLM provider and model. Your choice persists across sessions. Supported providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama (local), and OpenRouter (any model).

---

## Slash Commands

Quick commands that bypass the AI agent and call the Kalshi API directly.

| Command | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `/help` | Show all available commands | `/help` |
| `/status` | Exchange open/closed status | `/status` |
| `/balance` | Account balance | `/balance` |
| `/positions` | Open positions with P&L | `/positions` |
| `/orders` | Resting (open) orders | `/orders` |
| `/markets [series]` | Browse markets, optionally filter by series ticker | `/markets KXBTC` |
| `/market <ticker>` | Market detail + top-of-book orderbook | `/market KXBTC-26MAR-B80000` |
| `/buy <ticker> <count> [price]` | Buy YES contracts (price in cents) | `/buy KXBTC-26MAR-B80000 5 56` |
| `/sell <ticker> <count> [price]` | Sell YES contracts | `/sell KXBTC-26MAR-B80000 5 60` |
| `/cancel <order_id>` | Cancel a resting order | `/cancel abc-123-def` |

**Trade confirmation:** `/buy` and `/sell` always show a confirmation prompt before executing. Type `yes` to confirm or `no` to cancel.

**Price format:** Prices are always in cents. `56` = $0.56 = 56% implied probability.

## Natural Language Queries

This is the primary way to use the bot. The AI agent has access to all the tools below and will chain them together automatically.

### Example Queries

**Market research:**
- "What are the odds of Trump winning in 2028?"
- "Show me all open Bitcoin markets"
- "What's the implied probability of the Fed cutting rates this month?"
- "Find markets related to AI regulation"

**Price and data:**
- "What's the current price of KXBTC-26MAR-B80000?"
- "Show me the orderbook for KXBTC-26MAR-B80000"
- "Give me a price history chart for this market over the last week"

**Portfolio:**
- "What's my balance?"
- "Show me my open positions and P&L"
- "List my recent fills"
- "Do I have any resting orders?"

**Trading (requires confirmation):**
- "Buy 10 YES contracts of KXBTC-26MAR-B80000 at 55 cents"
- "Sell my position in KXBTC-26MAR-B80000"
- "Cancel all my resting orders"
- "Place a limit order: 5 YES on KXPRES-28-DJT at 30 cents"

**Web research:**
- "What's the latest news about the 2028 presidential race?"
- "Search for recent Bitcoin ETF developments"

## Tool Reference

The agent has access to the following tools. You never call these directly — the agent selects them based on your query.

### kalshi_search (Market Research Router)

The primary research tool. Takes your natural language query and automatically routes to the right Kalshi API endpoints across up to **3 iterations** (browse → drill down → analyze).

**How it works:**
1. An LLM reads your query and decides which sub-tools to call
2. Sub-tool results are collected and the LLM decides if it needs more data
3. If so, it calls additional sub-tools (e.g., drilling into a specific event for contract prices)
4. After at most 3 iterations (or when the LLM has enough data), combined results are returned

**Sub-tools available to the router:**

## Ticker Formats

Kalshi uses a hierarchical ticker system:

| Level | Format | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Series | `KXBTC` | `KXBTC` | A recurring topic (e.g., Bitcoin price) |
| Event | `KXBTC-26MAR` | `KXPRES-28` | A specific occurrence (e.g., March 2026 BTC, 2028 election) |
| Market | `KXBTC-26MAR-B80000` | `KXPRES-28-DJT` | A single yes/no contract within an event |

**Price interpretation:** All prices are in **cents** (1-99). A price of `56` means $0.56, which implies a **56% probability** of the YES outcome. YES + NO prices always sum to approximately 100 cents.

## Tips

- **Demo mode**: Set `KALSHI_USE_DEMO=true` to trade with fake money while learning
- **Multi-step research**: The search router automatically drills down — ask "what's the implied probability of X" and it will find the event, then fetch contract-level prices
- **Be specific**: "BTC markets closing this week" works better than "crypto"
- **Trade safely**: All trades require explicit confirmation. The agent will show you the order details and ask for approval
- **Web + Kalshi**: Combine web search with market data — "what's the latest polling for 2028 and how do Kalshi odds compare?"
